### Webhook handler

* The Pep8 validator test came out with multiple errors such as: multiple line too long, trailing whitespace. All of them have been fixed and after I run the validator for the second time all codes were right [View the test](https://res.cloudinary.com/anto8913/image/upload/v1639092241/4th%20milestone/Validation-python-test/checkout/checkout-webhoo-handlers_b22bmq.jpg). Infortunately when I copied to my workspace and I saved, the terminal showed me multiple syntax errors and when I tryed to open the port I was not able to do it. So for not breaking the website functionalities I decided to leave the file without the fixes from pep8.


### Webhooks

* The Pep8 validator test came out after the first time with differents errors like: trailing whitespace, blank line contain whith space and line to long. All of there have been fixed and the validator has been run again. The second time came out completely right, nut inside the workspace I got this error that was not present inside the validator: 'local variable 'e' is assigned to but never used'/'variable name 'e' doesn't conform to snake_case naming style pylint. After differents resources and questions asked in slack I did not find any solutions for this and for the website funcitonality I decided to leave the error untouched.
