# Html Validator

## Home

* The first time that I run the validator the document came out with 4 errors and 1 warning. The errors were: the type attribute is not allowed inside i element, the h4 element is not allowed inside the a element and the last one, the element a must not appear as a descendant of the button element. The first 2 errors has been fixed but about the last one I left ountuched just for a style reason. [View test here]()


## Products

* The first time that I run the validator the document came out with 2 warnings related to the aria-label. Because is a warning I decided to leave ountuched.


## Add product

* The first time that I run the validator the document came out with 2 warnings related to the aria-label and 2 errors "duplicate attribute type and duplicate attribute id" This error has been supervisioned with the help of chrome devtools where I did not find the duplicates, so I assume that is error is caused from the loop.[View test here]()


## Edit product

* This page contains the 2 duplicate errors and 1 img error that says: img element should habe an alt attribute. I left the first 2 errors ountuched because the same reason above and for the alt attribute, because the edit page comes straight with the product image from products page I did not find the element on the workspace to fix it.[View test here]()

* The first time I run the validator for this template, the test came out with 3 warnings. The 2 aria-label warnings and an empty heading warning.
