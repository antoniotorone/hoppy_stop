# Home

## Carousel

* The carousel is the best element to describe what the website is for, very straight and located on the home page like a welcome. The carousel has been made with these extravagant background colours to create happiness, and go to check it out. In my opinion, the background colours make me happy, and also they create a nice contrast with the cans beer image.
