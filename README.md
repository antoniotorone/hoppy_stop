## Testing

### Testing user stories from user experience (UX section)

####  First time visitor

1. As a first-time visitor, I want to get to a website that makes me feel like to be in the right place, as in a live beer shop.

   1. For these user stories, the logo and the carousel slices do the job. The logo is designed with a hopp inside, the leading beer ingredient and the logo shape as a stop signal, plus the colour tells the user 'stop, beer here have a look'.
   
   2. The carousel slices helps as well with these inviting and warm background colours and originals stamps on the can beers.

2. As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to see what the website can offer me.

   1. The website contains ??? products, divided into categories, straightforward to reach with the button 'shop all' and the navigation bar on the header, where a bright RED?? hover colour gets the user attention to choose the category needs and navigate with one click.

3. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to get a quick and accurate research of a specific product or a specific type of beer.

I ARRIVED HERE TO CHECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   1. The website has been developed with back-end codes that take care about this specific function. All products can be found by:
   * name
   * description
   * beer taste ( citrus, fruity, tropical)
   * beer style ( lager, pale ale, ipa, stout)

   There is only one exception, the glasses obviously can not be found with the beer taste and the beer style criteria.
